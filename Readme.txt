    *Issues:1)Fix the Inconsistent Vertical gap,Relative to Horizontal gap, between to vertical color divs,
           2)Fix the working of button,
           2)Aling the h2 to center horizontally

     Namaste Mowa,     
              click on any color and a new 'Button' and a 'h2' text emerge on the screen,
              
              On clicking the Button, It's supposed to delete itself and the h2 tag,(edit1-) But it isn't working for more than 1 click.
